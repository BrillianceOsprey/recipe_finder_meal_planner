# Recipe Finder Meal Planner(MealMatch)

## Overview

**Recipe Finder Meal Planner(MealMatch)** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users organize their meals by assigning favorite recipes to each day of the week. It provides full offline support by storing data locally with Hive, and smartly detects online/offline status to always deliver the best user experience. The app connects to a recipe API when online, but remains fully functional when offline.

**Pro Tips:**
- Donâ€™t forget to mention any required API keys if the recipe API needs one.
- Register your Hive adapters for each model you save locally (e.g. `Recipe`, `MealPlan`).
- If you have screenshots, add them to make your README even more attractive!
